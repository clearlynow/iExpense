# iExpense
100 Days of SwiftUI, Days 36-38, Project 7

# Description
an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs. 
At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent), 
but in order to accomplish those two things youâ€™re going to need to learn how to:
-Present and dismiss a second screen of data.
-Delete rows from a list
-Save and load user data
